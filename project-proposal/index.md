# Project Proposal

<h2>Introduction</h2>

I am asking for the Small Team Grant of $50,000 to pursue my project of remembering the historically significant Honest Ed’s in Toronto through a community driven physical and online museum. As a resident of Toronto for my whole short 20 years of life, I have come to see this city grow staggeringly quickly. With growth comes replacement, which, again, is something that a city-dweller is used to. Honest Ed’s was officially closed December 31, 2016, and it has been completely destroyed by the time I am writing this. Now when I pass it multiple times a week, I always stop and look at its different stages of redevelopment, and always there are others doing the same thing, whether they walk past it every day or are only in the area rarely. Citizens were furious, sad, sentimental, and some were joyous in remembrance and moving on. David Mirvish, son of Ed, said this about the ending of an era: “My father was not sentimental. My father thought that businesses should fulfil needs, people’s needs, and if they didn’t, they didn’t deserve to survive” (<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/12/10/david-mirvish-looks-back-at-all-those-honest-eds-memories.html">The Star</a>). He also said “It’s strange that we began in retailing and we still are in retailing of sorts, but what we retail now is ephemeral, we sell memories… When the show is over, that’s all that you really have” (<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/12/10/david-mirvish-looks-back-at-all-those-honest-eds-memories.html">The Star</a>). Its true that now that there is no more store, it exists only in the memories which hold it dear, which is why it is more important to preserve them. I am not enthusiastic for this just for the sake of it, but because I know how much citizens felt like a part of their lives was just removed, and that it deeply effects many people in the neighbourhood and Toronto; this is why I believe such a project is not only important, but necessary. I believe that we should always be developing with the future and past generations in mind, meaning that the future and present generations should have access to the history of their city. This should also include the history of the land without settler contact, as well as the forced acquisition of land from indigenous populations by the settler governments. This project however, will only tackle a very small amount of history, and also will tackle contemporary issues of gentrification, representation in cities, entrepreneurial difficulties, and rapidly changing communities.
This project will have many aspects, both online and physical, including a website with oral histories, maps, videos, pictures, texts, news articles past and present, and a space for engaging in discussion and keeping up with the community. An ambitious part of this project is to have a part of the new development include a physical recreation of Honest Ed’s as a small part of their new _Mirvish Village_. Crowdsourcing will be used to attain artefacts and stories.
To be completely honest, while I was researching for this project I found an individual name Jay Pitter who had an idea very similar in 2016 called the <a href="http://www.eraarch.ca/2016/the-honest-eds-project-a-contemporary-intangible-heritage-project-guest-blog-by-jay-pitter"> Honest Ed’s Project </a>, and I hope to work with her to bring our ideas to fruition since there is no updates on her project since 2016. There is also great promise that Westbank (the developers behind the construction) would be interested in including a project like this because they have indicated the importance of <a href="http://mirvish-village.com/the-project/heritage">heritage</a> in their plans. I hope to include in this project the city of Toronto, the Mirvish family, and other community organizations that are interested, as well as using crowdsourcing to collect information on citizens and their experiences, memories, and physical remnants of Honest Ed’s.

<h2>Methods</h2>


For the website, the tools needed will be very simple. There will be a webpage with basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, enabling dynamic functions. One of these functions will be mapping out the community that engaged with Honest Ed’s, from their homes in Toronto, to their present location, and even mapping if they came to Canada as an immigrant where they or their family came from. Stories in audio, text, and video form will be collected from existing archives as well as work conducted by us engaging with the community. On the website will be an online museum of signs, products, mirrors, etc from the store, which will be interactively created to the best of our ability to be placed in the context of the actual store. This will require heavy work from our computer science and software creators to work with layouts of the store as well as descriptions and pictures collected to recreate a digital replica of Honest Ed’s. I am confident that this is possible, knowing that there are skilled students and professionals alongside a vast archive of data on this historic building. Another prominent part of the website will be the focus on recent news concerning development in Toronto as well as the neighbourhood in general. Historical news articles will also be collected and centralized on this website, for obvious reasons, but I think the inclusion of the present day will attract people even more. The way in which history survives and provides any sort of meaning is when it is enjoyed by the public, and they will be able to see a history while at the same time being able to see what opportunities are available to them and what is going on in the neighbourhood and how they can be a part of it. Organizations we will partner with will have their own space on the page to connect with visitors to the webpage. Schools will be able to use it as a resource. This will be a place that historians, tourists, and citizens can come to and learn as deeply or shallowly as they desire, able to investigate oral histories, the diaspora of neighbourhoods, histories of Toronto and Honest Ed’s, news on current developments, and also be able to voice their opinion and join with others.
Apart from the online aspect, there will be a museum included in the new development of the condominium and public space of <a href="http://urbantoronto.ca/database/projects/mirvish-village-honest-eds-redevelopment">Mirvish Village</a>. This will be a huge effort made on our side to negotiate and work with the team behind the project to include our idea into theirs. The museum would take up 1 floor of a building around. 80 square metres Of course the space is not strict, but this amount of space is needed at least for an effective museum. Included will be artefacts placed in replicable context of the recreated space. The objects will be asked for from the public, and some money from our grant would be used to pay some citizens for participation. I believe that the best recording of community histories will be achieved through online and physical space, which is why I hope to incorporate both into this project. For this project, I propose that we will need an office space in order to be organized, have regular meetings, and to be collaborative and being able to invite collaborators to our safe space. The most concerning aspects of this project lie in the reliance on other organizations and business, which I am hopeful for, but still not able to secure agreements with, especially with no money yet. This is why I need more legitimacy for this project. Another obstacle is the attempting to create a replica of a place that no longer exists. Of course I do not aim or wish to create Honest Ed’s as a truthful exact replica, but rather in the online and physical museum I want to give the feeling of what it was like to be in there; the crooked floor, the piles of consumer goods, the feeling of being lost, the old pictures and paintings on the walls, the iconic signs, the people doing their daily shopping, etc. This is more difficult online, which is why I wish to accompany it with the physical museum, but It is possible with creativity and adaptive learning as well as skilled programmers of which there are many I could have the opportunity of working with.

<h2>Timeline</h2>

This project would need approximately 2 years. The first phase will be in March-April when I will be hiring undergrad and graduate students from across Toronto and the GTA to employ them with summer jobs and possibly continually working in the school year. Students from various disciplines will be needed from computer science, to humanities, social sciences, commerce and management, and architecture and design. In August I will hire non-students so there will be a more diverse and experienced team along with those trying to get experience. The team would ideally consist of 2 researchers, 2 outreach leaders, 2 web designers with one specializing in the building replica project, a business expert, and an assistant for each team equalling to 4 assistants who will most likely be undergraduate students. Work will begin in May with preliminary research, web design, outreach to community businesses and residents, and working with Westbank to make plans as well as collaborating with Jay Pitter. There will be people focused on either the online or physical aspect of the project, and this will create two teams that will work and meet together. After we get initial steps of creating the website, making meetings with organizations, collecting data on Honest Ed’s history from archives and oral history, I will send flyers out to everyone and business in the neighbourhood, as well as advertising to be part of this project with some money incentives as well. Collection of all the proper information will be done by our researchers who will work in the archives as well as with communities. This is where funding from the Mirvish family and the City of Toronto will play in, as we hope they will find this project enriching the city and portraying a truthful image of the past. Work will need to be done to design the physical museum and have blueprints as well as estimations on how it will work. In the first year, the focus will be on gathering resources online, and for the museum which will be the main focus of the second year. During the first year we will also ask the public what they would like to see in the physical museum in preparation for the year to come. Employers may wish to work only 1 year or half a year, which they can do. The second year, the museum will begin creation. This is the most unknown aspect of this project because of the reliance on outside interests and cooperation. If this ceases to be a possibility, the online only aspect of the project will still serve as a sufficient research hub, discussion centre, and sense of community and local history. Either way, by the end of two years we will have all of this completed and will work towards the continuation of the project either run by the city or interested donors in order to keep the website and museum alive.

<h2>Importance</h2>

There is a mural that I used to pass frequently with a quote of Jane Jacobs saying "Cities have the capability of providing something for everybody, only because, and only when, they are created by everybody." This quote is essentially the goal of this project, which means a lot to me personally, but also includes others who I know will find it important. Cities, especially ones like Toronto that claim multicultural havens, are growing quickly and should include the voices of those who live in it. This is an opportunity for citizens to put themselves in their city, and to pass down their experiences to future generations. I know this is an ambitious project which has many different aspects, but it is something I would work for and fight for because I do think it is of paramount importance. I think it will benefit so many members of the community, by employing humanities students who cannot for the life of them find a job, giving computer science students the ability to be involved with a project and not just act as a machine, allowing voices to be heard that may not have otherwise, providing the opportunity for citizens to create and be part of their own museum, and allowing citizens who have no idea what this place is or was to learn about it easily. I think with organizations like <a href="http://www.myseumoftoronto.com/"> Myseum</a> providing people to become more a part of their city, this will be a great addition, where ordinary people are trying to make sense of their city and their place within it and in relation to others. Honest Ed’s might not seem like such an important historical location in the grand scheme of things, It only lasted for 68 years and took up a block of a large city, but it is important to discuss it in this context because such a seemingly little thing actually impacted many people’s lives as low-income residents, newcomers, tourists, single parents raising a family, and many more experiences in this city. Little histories shouldn’t be discounted because they are little, but rather located within larger discussions of history. The rapid development of this city concerns many, and such an event of the closing of Honest Ed’s gives the perfect grounds to discuss this. The online resources and communication built in the website, as well as the museum located where the store used to be, this project will serve as just that; a way to remember an important chapter of life, and relate it to the present ones.
