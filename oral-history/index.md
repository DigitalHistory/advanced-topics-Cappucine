After the devastating bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th, 1945, Japan undertook an introspective reconstruction in ideology, alongside the US occupation beginning in October 1945-1952. Japan had since the Meiji restoration promoted a national ideology of modernity under the emperor, but after the war this ideology had proved unsuccessful and wrong. After their defeat, peace and democracy were embraced as an alternative, which diverse ideologies moved through self-criticism towards; Marxists, Neoliberalists, Americans and Japanese.[1](#1) As __Hanneman__ explains, "The area of debate thus was not whether democracy should be achieved, but how, for whom, and why." [2](#2) However, just because there was no violent opposition in the early stages of ideological development among intellectuals, it cannot be ignored that the nation was not moving as a homogeneous body. This new peace imperative was adopted by Japan, and by global organizations as well. Among them today are: [Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament](http://www.cnduk.org/),  [Global Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime](https://www.cfr.org/report/global-nuclear-nonproliferation-regime), [Disarmament in South Africa]( http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/south-africa-nuclear-disarmament/),  [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]( http://www.nti.org/analysis/reports/nuclear-disarmament/),  [Disarmament in Canada]( http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/canada/), [United Nations office for Disarmament Affairs]( https://www.un.org/disarmament/), [Mayors for Peace](http://www.mayorsforpeace.org/english/), and  [PeaceBoat]( http://peaceboat.org/english/).


__Akira Kawasaki__, a speaker on behalf of Peaceboat, spoke at the same seminar with Dr Clifton Truman Daniel (grandson of President Truman) and _Hibakusha_ victims including __Satsuko Thurlow__ who explains her story in the audio clip above. He describes the motives of the organization not to tell stories for the sake of invoking pity, but for people to learn something from them and apply the stories to contemporary problems, and so they invite _Hibakusha_ to tell stories on their touring boats, uniting those who experienced nuclear explosions or radiation, as well as others suffering from wars, violence, and lack of human rights.[3](#3)
Despite a common goal, pacifism from 1945 onwards had not been easy. It has been explored differently by citizens, _Hibakusha_ (atomic bomb survivors), officials, intellectuals, foreigners, the US, and the state. After occupation, the US confiscated 153 war propaganda paintings, others destroyed, approaching pacifism by elimination and repression.[4](#4) Scholars like __Yasui Koaru__ had made the opposition to nuclear weapons acceptable to those on the Right by focusing on emotional and national victimhood, while not angering supporters of America.[5](#5)



<h3>Pacifism in art</h3>
__Hanneman__ argues that it was the intellectuals who helped pull together Japanese society after the war, with important figures on both the Right and Left working to oppose the pre-war ideology.[6](#6) Though she is correct that intellectuals were scrambling to cement a confusing post-war situation, engaging in public discourse and forming new ideologies, what cannot be ignored is the ways in which artists were reacting in their own political and personal ways to the war.
__Iri and Toshi Maruki__ created fifteen panels beginning in 1950, depicting the moment and effects of the atomic bomb.[7](#7) <a href="javascript:seek(710)"> </a> Their experience arises from their arrival in Hiroshima days after the bombing to look for family members, while the city was still on fire.[8](#8) They also depict American prisoners of war and Korean residents living in the cities at the time of the bombing. The panels are expression but also in protest against censorship of the bombing events by the US. __Chuzo Tamotzu__ was born in Japan but lived in America as an artist, and tried with his work to reconcile between the country of his birth and the country of his home. He had immense hope for youth, and created a project based on his vision of a peaceful relationship between American and Japanese children, where in 1953 he organized an exchange of art between New Mexico and Hiroshima primary school children.[9](#9) __Isamu Noguchi__ explored through his artpiece _Memorial to Man_, 1947, the inevitability of the end of human life on earth, after war events like the atomic bomb. [10](#10)

Keiji Nakazawa, author of [Barefoot Gen]( https://archive.org/details/manga_BarefootGen-v01), is also a _Hibakusha_. Barefoot Gen is based off of his own experiences and at times that of others who experienced the bomb. His father was anti-war at a time when the Japanese fascist empire didn’t allow for dissent, and Keiji took after his fathers distaste for the Japanese military and never forgave them for starting the war. [11](#11) He used comics to critique war and nuclear power as well as a way to avenge his mother who passed away from radiation seven years after the war. [12](#12) Nakazawa states in the prelude to his first volume of Barefoot Gen: “I hope that Gen’s story conveys to its readers the preciousness of peace and the courage we need to live strongly, yet peacefully.”[13](#13)
_Barefoot Gen_ retells not only the story of an atomic bomb survivor in the immediate aftermath of the bomb, but their life extended after, changed in all possible ways. Through his various volumes, he explores multiple aspects of post-bomb life: His sister kidnapped by a gang, American soldiers beatings kids, radiation effects, social stigma around radiation victims, using survivors as lab-rats, Japanese residents turning on each other for survival, the black market for victims bodies, corruption, and much more. [14](#14) Nakazawa expresses his hatred for both the Japanese and American sides. In the Manga, like in real life, the Emperor was visiting his school, and he was questioning why he still had to show respect when he blamed the Emperor for causing unnecessary death and not taking responsibility for it. [15](#15)
What _Barefoot Gen_ does academically is portray a more complete picture of events leading up to, during, and after the bomb. In an interview, Nakawaza explains all of the suffering he and others went through, which goes beyond the obvious concern for burns, radiation, and death of family members. His memories of death in the city were burned into his brain, along with the stench of it. He suffered from hunger after the war, explaining the reliance of scavenging clams at the mouth of the river.[16](#16) He was bullied for being a victim, and was outnumbered often. [17](#17) He saw how kids were taken from their families to be experimented on by the Atomic Bomb Casualty Comission. [18](#18) He explains how the miraculous recovery of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was felt as less of a recovery by the _Hibakusha_ themselves, instead being discriminated against. [19](#19)He left Hiroshima for Tokyo and never wanted to go back, though even in Tokyo he was discriminated against, and avoided for fear of radiation. [20](#20)


<h3> Hibakusha Stories </h3>
Though many _Hibakusha_ expressed their experiences through art, others stayed silent, and others told their stories to the world. __Satsuko Thurlow__, the woman speaking in the audio clip located at the top of this page, is keen to tell her story even though she must remember horrific events constantly, because she believes it is important for survivors to share their experience to ensure human beings never have to go through what they had to. [21](#21) During a [seminar]( https://www.japansociety.org/webcast/special-program-for-high-school-students), survivors and peace promoters discussed how youth forgets the impact of the war because of the prosperity that Japan now experiences. Thurlow believes it is crucial for the old to pass on stories to the youth since the Japanese government has not been adequately assuming this role of passing on a painful yet true past. __Yuan Cai__ argues that generational change a leading factor in the decline of pacifism. [22](#22)
Satsuko’s approach to pacifism was not the same as the state, or occupation forces, or even other Japanese citizens. The US desired to transform Japan into a democratic and peaceful country by abolishing the military and promoting liberal policies, however their motive was to keep communism controlled in the surrounding East Asia, and they were still experimenting with nuclear power and waging war elsewhere. [23](#23) Satsuko’s drive is from personal experience, and a general wish for the end of human suffering by the hands of man-made phenomena. The Japanese state was much more concerned with the development of a nation around the new ideology. Noriyuki Masuda, associate director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Association, said there was a crisis involving young people’s consciousness and that the interest in Japan as a nation was declining.[24](#24)A concern with the lack of unified peace ideology is a worry for those who experienced the war, but also to those trying to uphold a certain national ideology. We are reminded of what importance oral history provides when reminded that these ideas are carried on with the people who survived an event, and that they are not permanent, and they resemble a certain time and place, and in the case of Hiroshima and Nagasaki _Hibakusha_, their stories are today not often respected or shown as much interest in as they were even 20 years ago.


Despite the reconstruction of Hiroshima, many survivors moved away from their home city because of the painful association. Survivor __Yasuaki Yamashita__ moved to Japan, and in the beginning found it very hard to talk about his experiences, but overtime he had found it easier, and more necessary to share his story for the possibility of peace in the world. [25](#25) Satsuko visited America before moving to Canada and experienced hatred for her nuclear experimenting, leading her to emerge as a stronger activist against all nuclear activity even though she was challenged by the public and the courts. [26](#26) By listening to Satsuko's testimony, and others like hers, what is learned is valuable to understanding the reactions of Japanese citizens to the devastation the war brought.  Along with other _Hibakusha_ stories, which describe similar experiences of not only death, injury, separation, and damage, but of societal changes and long-lasting physical and mental health effects. Nakazawa’s story is also important to understanding more intricate aspects of post-war society. When his first Mangas were received by the public, the reactions he was surprised that people knew so little about the events of the bomb, and were actually learning about it from his work. [27](#27) People living in Japan didn’t experience the war the same way all over, and since speaking out as a survivor brought shame and alienation, initially the stories were not being told.


The decline in pacifism raises important questions about how prevalent national memory must be in new generations. What do we remember as a society, and truly learn from? Surely events like 9/11 are strong in many American memories, though this is a cliché example, I might instead use the memory of the first or second world war in general, because the globe was affected by them even if they did not participate in the wars themselves. Those from the first world war are remembered even less than the second, and even from the second, there are few remaining to ensure that such events are remembered collectively. Perhaps it is not possible to enforce such a memory without state control, perhaps it is too much to ask for to have generations following remember an event that though historically significant, doesn’t apply to people’s everyday lives.
When we do history, sometimes we can tend to lose direction or purpose; why does this matter, how is this useful? These are questions that I think of constantly while researching or learning about a historical topic. Stories like those of the testimonies of Atomic Bomb survivors provide a way to locate the humanity in an otherwise cold-blooded history. By listening, we give survivors the space to insert themselves in history. In doing this, the event of the bombings becomes rich with various information on much more than just facts, providing unique learning opportunities.
  >“in the context of a unit on Hiroshima they [Hibakusha Stories] provide an excellent educational opportunity for using oral history.  It is precisely the highly charged emotional nature of the task that challenges our capacities to listen with both compassion and critical intelligence.” James J. Orr, Professor of Japanese History, Remembrance of Hiroshima, and Nationa; Identity in East Asia [28](#28)
