# Do spaces



Then add those places to the marker array in [../js/maps-setup.js](../js/maps-setup.js) (see instructions there).


In Japan, like most places, there have been many different regimes and so-called 'eras' . Another thing we know is that governments when changing regimes often change the architecture, to define the space in which they reign. See china creating neighborhood squares where little communities lived inside the squares and this was so that the overseers of each block could keep a better look on the citizens. you can technically define japan by its economical eras, from feudalism to mercantilism, imperialism.
okay so what iam i going to do i want to mark places where there used to be buildings that are now destroyed, and aditionally what has REPLACED THEM.
NUCLEAR BOMBS AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE
SHOULD I ALSO CONNECT THE DESTRUCTION JUST BY EARTHWUAKE AND HAVE THEM INA DIF COLOR.
WEHAT WE LOSE TO showMarkers.
THEN THERES THE CULTURAL DESTRUCTION OF ISIL
each marker will show:
a building or structure that was destroyed. the amount of lives lost. the ones who destroyed the building. picture of before and after.the amount of money spent on recovering it. what is there NOW



war manifests itself in the destruction it leaves behind. Some nations and organizations have chosen to take that destruction and make it eternal, and in other cases, a structure is lost forever.
though there are many examples, here are the ones in which i believe relate the most to my thesis:
explosions,

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, above the map and buttons. To change the bootswatch thenme, change "united" to one of the other theme names listed at [strapdownjs.com](http://strapdownjs.com/).
