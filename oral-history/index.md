After the devastating bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th, 1945, Japan undertook an introspective reconstruction in ideology, alongside the US occupation beginning in October 1945-1952. Japan had since the Meiji restoration promoted a national ideology of democracy with their new constitution, but after the war this ideology had proved unsuccessful at least in the way it was executed. this is something that the majority agreed upon; Marxists, Neoliberalists, Americans and Japanese(SCHOLAR). as SCHOLAR denotes, "The area of debate thus was not whether democracy should be achieved, but how, for whom, and why."(SCHOLAR)

As described in the short essay [Hiroshima: Hypo-centre of Peace?](!!!!!!!!!!!!!), a new peace imperative was adopted by Japan, and by global organizations as well. Among them are [Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament](http://www.cnduk.org/),  [Global Nuclear Nonproliferation Regime](https://www.cfr.org/report/global-nuclear-nonproliferation-regime), [Disarmament in South Africa]( http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/south-africa-nuclear-disarmament/),  [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]( http://www.nti.org/analysis/reports/nuclear-disarmament/),  [Disarmament in Canada]( http://www.nti.org/learn/countries/canada/), [United Nations office for Disarmament Affairs]( https://www.un.org/disarmament/), [Mayors for Peace](http://www.mayorsforpeace.org/english/), and  [PeaceBoat]( http://peaceboat.org/english/).

Akira Kawasaki, a speaker on behalf of Peaceboat, spoke at the same talk with Truman Daniel, Thurlow, and Yamashita, discussing a peaceful future for Japan and the world. He describes the motives of the organization not to tell stories for the sake of invoking pity, but for people to learn something from them and apply the stories to contemporary problems, and so they invite _Hibakusha_ to tell stories on their touring boats, uniting those who experienced nuclear explosions or radiation, as well as others suffering from wars, violence, and lack of human rights (https://www.japansociety.org/webcast/special-program-for-high-school-students). 

###Why Oral History?
By listening to Satsuko's testimony, and others like hers, what is learned is valuable to understanding the reactions of Japanese citizens to the devastation the war brought.  Along with other _Hibakusha_ (atomic bomb survivors) stories, which describe similar experiences of not only death, injury, separation, and damage, but of societal changes and long-lasting physical and mental health effects.

When we do history, sometimes we can tend to lose direction or purpose; why does this matter, how is this useful? These are questions that I think of constantly while researching or learning about a historical topic. Stories like those of the testimonies of Atomic Bomb survivors provide a way to locate the humanity in an otherwise cold-blooded history. By listening, we give survivors the space to insert themselves in history. In doing this, the event of the bombings becomes rich with various information on much more than just facts, providing unique learning opportunities.

When Dr Clifton Truman Daniel, grandson of President Harry Truman, met with _Hibakusha_, they asked him to pass on their stories in order to educate the world into not letting this happen ever again(https://www.japansociety.org/webcast/special-program-for-high-school-students)
