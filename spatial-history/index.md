# Hiroshima: Hypo-centre of Peace?

War manifests itself in what it takes away from this world, and after it ends, victors and losers try to get back what was stolen by erecting structures of acknowledgment. But is it possible to solidify our mistakes in the form of a city to make sure they never happen again?

The first time nuclear weapons had ever been used in warfare was by the United States in the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6th and 9th, 1945. Hiroshima, due to its flat topography, was completely levelled. An estimated 200,000 people died, not counting those affected by radiation. The bombing has remained in memory, history and in the rebuilt city itself. From ground zero, a one-mile radius was completely destroyed apart from reinforced concrete buildings like the __Genbaku Dome__ (Atomic Bomb Dome), and the total reach of the explosion was a five-mile radius.[1](#one)

Post-war Hiroshima now represents a city of peace. Its reconstruction since the early years has been purposefully dedicated towards creating a city-wide monument of peace, remembrance, and a nuke-free world. This is far from a casual belief; it is an official ideology adopted by the city of Hiroshima, the nation, and those who visit daily.[18](#18) Furthermore, the physical space has been carefully designed to reflect that ideology, with attention to location and proximity. Though this topic has been researched thoroughly, it is necessary to visualize how the reconstruction of Hiroshima has occurred.

<h3>A New Narrative</h3>
History is a collection of narratives, and the new geography of Hiroshima tells a new narrative by infusing the space with meaning. That narrative is that of a lotus flower; rising from the ashes; becoming something from nothing. It is a narrative that has a beginning, and that beginning is the bomb, therefore it ignores many complexities of WWII and the role Japan had in it. The story has a happy ending, despite the thousands who died, because it ends as a world without war. The official flower is an Oleander because it was the first blossoming after the bomb; this is how integrated the bomb is in Hiroshima memory.[4](#four)

<h3>Reconstruction</h3>

Reconstruction was on the minds of citizens and officials soon after the destruction, after all, planners were in a unique historical situation where they could choose what would emerge from the pile of rubble. In 1946, the _Chugoku Shimbun_ (Chinese Newspaper) ran a competition for visions of the city. Sankishi Toge won, envisioning a peace memorial, library, museum, and gathering space dedicated to peace, as well as 40% greenery.[5](#five) In 1947, Hiroshima Mayor Shinzo Hamai declared “Let us join together to sweep from this Earth the horror of war, and to build a true peace.”[6](#six) It wasn’t until the __Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law__ was enacted that money was filtered in by the nation, and land was turned over to the city. This law set the stage for Hiroshima to receive a make-over.[7](#seven) In __Peace Memorial Park__, over 60 monuments have been erected to the remembrance of those who died in the bombing. All of them can be seen in their [online museum](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/tour_e/tour_fra_e.html). Even some individuals with relations to those involved in the dropping of the bomb turned to participating in the peace reconstruction ideology. Clifton Truman Daniel, the grandson of president Truman, works with _Hibakusha_, the term for survivors of the atomic bomb explosion.[8](#eight) A local yoga instructor puts it succinctly when he says: “The image of Hiroshima’s reconstruction is much more powerful than that of its destruction.”[9](#nine)

<h3>History Neglected</h3>
Hiroshima has gone through many different periods giving different meaning to the city.  In the Meiji Period, the city became a central figure in industry manufacturing, and in Japan’s transition to capitalism. Scott O’Bryan, associate professor of History and East Asian Studies, states: “The almost exclusive attention given to the day of the bombing itself ironically works to efface the key roles that the city did indeed play in modern empire and war-making.”[10](#ten) __Hiroshima Castle__ was built by a warlord in the 16th century and used for military purposes. After it was destroyed, it was rebuilt in 1958 and made into a museum of the city's history. In this way, surely the city acknowledged their past, yet its reconstruction has served as a tourist destination first and foremost. The Japanese government temporarily moved to Hiroshima during the Sino-Japanese war. [11](#11)The city’s role was primarily to support the war, and this is seldom mentioned in the memorials. Stories of Chinese and Korean victims of the bomb, and mention of Japan’s violent aggression during the war, were not included in the initial peace memorials built by the city.[12](#12),[13](#13) This is not to say whether it is an ethical decision or not; people are still alive from the war who cannot talk about history without evoking a personal connection to it, and this makes it difficult to make decisions about what a monument should really say about an event. However, the narrative that replaced the old one had no concern with pre-bomb history, or other contextual information. The new narrative also happens to be object to the fact that they could only create new buildings, and therefore the city became doubly as ignorant of the past. Many _have_ criticized the city for focusing only on history since August 6th 1945, and others continue to defend the purpose that Hiroshima serves as a true reminder of what horror a nuclear bomb can create.

<h3>Dark Tourism</h3>
Another criticism has been the development of tourism in the rebuilding of Hiroshima. When one looks up any information on Hiroshima on the internet, multiple travel sites return with the same information; information given by the city usually. This makes inquiring about other information more difficult, as the buildings that aren’t dedicated to peace-promotion are less researched or cared about in relation to the 60 monuments in the Peace Memorial Park. Shafer states “the formation of Hiroshima memory was also strongly influenced by the city’s general reconstruction efforts as well as the municipal tourism strategy."[15](#15)  It is not a dirty secret that revenue from tourism helped to build the city, or that this was a strategy by city planners, however it was a top-down decision made with a partially profit-driven purpose, meaning the narrative is not detached from politics.

<h3>__Map of Significant Post-War Structures__</h3>
The purpose of showing the markers and areas is to compare and contrast Pre-war and Post-war Hiroshima and their differences in meaning contained in the geography, which fit it into a larger discussion of the Post-war narrative in Japan. Most buildings that are significant are located in or near the [Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park](http://www.pcf.city.hiroshima.jp/virtual/VirtualMuseum_e/tour_e/tour_fra_e.html), completed in 1954. In previous eras, the area had been a commercial centre of trade, and during Hiroshima’s transition to capitalism it served as a commercial and political centre home to City Hall. After the __1949 Reconstruction Law__,it was decided that the area would become a peace memorial, and is now home to 60 buildings and monuments dedicated to remembrance of the destruction caused by nuclear weapons. On the map, it is easy to see which buildings were deemed important after the bombing, as well as which historically important buildings were transformed in meaning.

<h3>Interpretation of the Map</h3>
The older structures mostly stayed physically identical prior to the bomb, but most of them have been repurposed (Bank, A-bomb Dome, Station).
The new structures, apart from housing and non-political buildings, resemble the new ideology by being dedicated to peace (Peace Memorial Park and the 60 memorials within, Memorial Museum).
Other structures had been rebuilt to look like they had previously, and rebuilt to include their purpose relating to their relationship to the atomic bomb (Hiroshima Castle, Rest House, Shima Hospital, Shimakami Shrine, Elementary School).
The cluster of significant buildings are located close to the hypo-center itself. Most of them incorporate a relationship to the atomic bomb, while others attempt to reimagine a prosperous post-war cityscape. All of them have been thoughtfully planned out, as city planners were faced for the first time with the option of what to make of their situation.
It should be noted that there is far too little research accessible non-locally and in English on the buildings that exist in Hiroshima today, and historical buildings, but the Hiroshima Peace Museum is a great resource for this information.


<h3>The Atomic Bomb Dome</h3>
Hiroshima’s ambition to upkeep the promotion of peace instead of the remembrance of war was, as Schafer argues, a decision made for the sake of marketing.[16](#16)  The reality was, for many, not a simple, unanimous or smooth transition to the post-war ideology. This is seen in the decision of what to do with the previously named Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, constructed in 1915, now known as the Genbaku Dome meaning atomic bomb dome. People were divided between keeping it to remember the power of the atomic bomb and removing it to put the tragic past behind them. Kenji Shiga, director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, describes it best: “Some people thought it should be torn down and that Hiroshima should be a completely new city. The hibakusha in particular didn’t want to see reminders of what had happened. That was one example of how difficult it was – and still is – to strike a balance between recognising the facts of history and building a modern city.”[17](#17)  What this untouched dome symbolizes, despite most of the rest of the city being new, is the physical manifestation of the ability to transform the meaning of a building from destruction into warning to validate the new post-war narrative. The name was changed, its previous purpose was ignored, and that the building was kept in order to have a physical artefact of the bomb. Yet it also resembles the inability to find a unanimous decision, and the multiple experiences during the war.

Though peace was used as a pacifying method in order to have a universal language for marketing purposes, nuclear war had caused such destruction that it was only natural to use the opportunity as a chance to promote peace. Nuclear power is not to be forgotten, and Hiroshima is every day a reminder of the capability of Nuclear power.
